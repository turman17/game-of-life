# Game of Life

This project is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life using C++.

## Description
Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Horton Conway. It is a zero-player game that evolves based on its initial state, requiring no further input. Players create an initial configuration and observe how it evolves.

## Features
- Implemented in C++
- Basic functionalities of Conway's Game of Life
- Customizable grid size and initial configuration

## Files
- `main.cpp`: Main entry point for the program
- `Simulation.cpp` and `Simulation.hpp`: Handles the game logic and simulation
- `grid.cpp` and `grid.hpp`: Manages the grid and cell states
- `Makefile`: Build instructions for the project

## Requirements
- C++ compiler
- Make

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/turman17/game-of-life
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd game-of-life/srcs
    ```
3. Build the project using Make:
    ```bash
    make
    ```
4. Run the executable:
    ```bash
    ./main
    ```
